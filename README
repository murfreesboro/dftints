#     Purpose      #
####################
This is a general python program to generate basis set derivatives value for a
given list of grid points. This is designed for use in a general DFT package.

Here is a list of points need attention:

1  basis set order
   the basis set order here is only for libint order (see the 
   shell.py for more information). If you need other type 
   of order, please modify the code in the shell.py.

2  the result is in general a three dimension array:
   phi(nCarBas,ng,nDeriv)
   nCarBas is the number of Cartesian type of basis set for the 
   given shell;
   ng is the number of grid points;
   nDeriv is the number of derivatives
   You may need other order to organize the derivatives, please
   modify the derivorder.py
